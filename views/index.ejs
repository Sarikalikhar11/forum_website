              Death does not and cannot constitute the continuance of ego in the same but another form. I have recently

              before their body, but the sense of loss here is the disappearance of all intelligence, memory and
              identity. Unless there are technigues or technical processes whereby human beings are caught at some point
              in their lives, prior to dementia, and that point is preserved, how can the person live on in any suitable
              form?
